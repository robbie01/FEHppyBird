Our game is flappy bird.
In the game, you play as a bird who's goal is to fly through a series of oncoming pipes.
The controls are simple and intuitive. All you have to do is tap the screen to make the bird "flap" and go upwards.
The game is both fun and frustrating, causing users to passionately continue to use it again and again.
