### Script
Our game is flappy bird. When you first start the game you see the menu, which contains four different buttons for you to click as well artwork of clouds, which are made of many circles.
When you click on the stats page, you will see a list of the top 5 high scores, which persist even after the game is closed.
When you click start, the game begins the single player game.
In the game, you play as a yellow bird who is always being accelerated downwards due to gravity.
To prevent the bird from hitting the ground, you must tap the screen to move the bird upward.
At the same time, you are flying towards a series of pipes.
In order to survive, you must fly between the randomly generated gaps in the pipes.
Each time you pass through a gap, you score a point, and your HUD is incremented by 1.
If you collide with a pipe, the game will end and you will be shown the game over screen.
From this screen you can click restart to replay the game.
Another thing that you can do after the game ends is go back to the homescreen.
Once we are here, we can check the stats page.
Here we can see that the scores have been updated and our new high score has been added.
